## About

[Redux](https://redux.js.org/) is a state management library that is commonly used with React. This project contains the same app built with Redux and [Apollo Client 3](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/v3.0-beta/migrating/apollo-client-3-migration/). You can use this to compare how to accomplish the same thing using Apollo Client 3 with less code than Redux.
